YAUOS (Yet Another Unix-like OS) is an hobby operating system i'm developing for educational purposes.   
The project is still in its earliest stages and i'm strill trying to structure the code to better support multiple architectures in the future.
Although not much functionality is yet found on this kernel, i have already added build instructions for those who might wish to base their work off this.
You can find them on the [wiki](https://github.com/schiavonedimitri/yauos/wiki/Build-Instructions)  
As soon as the project takes shape more info will be added and the wiki updated.
