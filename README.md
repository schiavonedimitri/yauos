YauOS (Yet another unix-like OS) is an hobby operating system i'm developing for educational purposes.   
The project is still in its earliest stages and i'm strill trying to structure the code to better support multiple architectures in the future.
Although not much functionality is yet found on this kernel, i have already added build instructions for those who might want to start an os of their own and use this as a skeleton.
You can find them on the [wiki](https://github.com/schiavonedimitri/yauos/wiki/Build-Instructions)  
The projects aims at supporting multiple architectures and platforms in the future, for now the only supported architecutre is "i386" and the only supported platform is "pc".  
As soon as the project takes shape more info will be added and the wiki updated.
