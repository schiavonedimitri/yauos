YauOS (Yet another unix-like OS) is an hobby operating system i'm developing for educational purposes.   
The project is still in its earliest stages and although not much functionality is yet found on this kernel, i have already added build instructions for those who might want to try and play with this.
You can find them on the [wiki](https://github.com/schiavonedimitri/yauos/wiki/Build-Instructions)
As soon as the project takes shape more info will be added and the wiki updated.

Update: Since this is an education homemade hobby operating system i'm making in my free time to learn more os development, i have decided to lower the project ambitions to simplify coding and getting something functional in less time.
The new goals for YauOs are:
- Being a Unix like clone with Posix compatibily.
- Support for the i386 32 bit architecture only.
- Support for booting only on legacy bios systems (no UEFI support).
- Support only for PC-AT platform.
- Support SMP only with the old MP specification.
- Being able to boot and work properly on real hardware (although old hardware).
